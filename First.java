/*
 How code is running?

 1)Compilation
 src code(.java) => compiler(JDK) => Byte code(.class)(works for all operating systems unless it has JRE)
 this do not occurs in cpp 
 hence we call java as a portable lang
 java apps by changing byte code can be run on any device

 2)Execution
 byte code => JVM(converts) => native code
